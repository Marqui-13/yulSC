# Yul Smart Contract 
This repo contains code for an example of a simple smart contract in Yul language.

The smart contract in the yul file defines a MyContract contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from the contract balance. The Yul assembly code uses the calldatacopy(), mload(), sload(), sstore(), add, sub, caller, and call instructions to read input data, access and modify contract storage, transfer funds, and emit events to log contract activity.
